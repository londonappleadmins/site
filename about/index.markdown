If you in some manner manage or administer devices with an Apple logo & work in London, or happen to be in town when a meet is happening... This is the group for you!

We generally run between 4 and 6 meetups a year in various locations across London.

Each meet up consists of a series 5 to 20 minute presentations, followed by Q & A and discussions. These presentations can be a short "Hello", "Look at this cool thing I did" or "I really need help understanding <something>..." The idea is for these to create discussion points.

After the presentations; we eat, drink & discuss.

That's it.

If you want to know more, please reach out to one of the London Apple Admins Herders:
