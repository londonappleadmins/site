On March 19th we had our second meet up. This time the good folks at [ThoughtWorks London](http://www.thoughtworks.com) not only offered us the use of their space, but also supplied beverages & food.

As you may see from the [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-V839MFNL/), the schedule has changed as we've learnt a few things.

A recording of the meet up can be found on our YouTube channel & has been embedded below;
