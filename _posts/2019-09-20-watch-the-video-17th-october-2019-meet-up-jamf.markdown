title: Watch the video! 17th October 2019 – Meet Up @ Jamf
---

London Apple Admins had a bit of a sabbatical. But fear not, we came back! Our October meet of 2019 was Jamf-packed when we joined erm, [Jamf](https://www.jamf.com/) at their offices in Clerkenwell! It was an eventful time of year with new OS releases from Apple, you came to our arena, kicked back with a Sangria* and did the Macarena as we welcomed Catalina!

Thank you to our speakers and special thanks to Megan Bull and Matt Taylor of Jamf who put in so much hard work to host and sponsored us!
