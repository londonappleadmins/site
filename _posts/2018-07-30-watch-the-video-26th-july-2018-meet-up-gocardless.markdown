As some of you may have heard, One of our fellow London Apple Admin herders was diagnosed with testicular cancer in January last year. 




In November, [Graham Gilbert's](https://grahamgilbert.com/) trademark beard will be going away, to be replaced by a glorious 'tache for [Movember](https://uk.movember.com/). He has setup a FaceBook fundraiser page and asks that instead of buying him a beer, please consider a donating.


[If this matters to you, click here and please donate any amount you can spare.](https://graham.at/fbmovember)

If you use any of his software, or like his website or any of his talks, you owe him ;)
