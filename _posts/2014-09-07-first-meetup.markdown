On September 3rd we had our first meet up, some 60 people had signed up to the event & around 45 attended & we had 8 speakers.

Many, many thanks for Charley & James @ Amsys for securing the venue & for all speakers & attendees. It was everything we all hoped for from a debut event.

If you missed the event, the transitions between speakers were flawlessly smooth & no one hollered through a door whilst people where presenting.

If you attended, you'll know the truth to the above & I truly hope you enjoyed the event.

In the next few days, a survey will be sent out to those whom attended & watch this space for the next event.

Please also visit or join the following to carry on the conversations from the night.
