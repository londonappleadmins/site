On April 20th, Sony Music kindly hosted us in their London office. Massive thanks to Ross Drummond at Sony for a fantastic evening and for Henry Stamerjohann for his most informative workshop!

Here's the schedule:



 	
  * 18:30 - 19:00 Arrive & mingle

 	
  * 19:00 - 19:20 "Life after The Event" - Ross Drummond, Sony Music

 	
  * 19:25 - 21:00 ["Zentral Demo / Workshop" - Henry Stamerjohann, Apfelwerk GmbH & Co.](/presentations/2018.02.20-LDNApplAdminsHenry20-04-17-3.pdf)

 	
  * 21:00 - ?? - [To the Pub](https://www.thebuildersarmskensington.co.uk/)!


Unfortunately, due to network issues, the live stream of the event was not successful and regretfully, Ross' presentation was not recorded as a result. However, Henry's Zentral workshop was caught - watch it below:
