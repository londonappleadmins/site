For our first meet of 2016, the lovely people at [ThoughtWorks](https://thoughtworks.com) are hosting us again. This meet will be slightly different - rather than presentations, we are having a steel cage deathmatch style panel entitled "To bind or not to bind" featuring David Acland (Amsys), Yannis Lagogiannis (LSE) and Francois Levaux-Tiffreau (Amaris).

Binding (or the lack of) to a directory service has been a hot topic recently in the Mac Admin community, especially since IBM said they were no longer binding their Macs and with the release of Enterprise Connect by Apple. Our panel of experts (and Ben and Graham) will be discussing the benefits, drawbacks of binding with the attendees and look at some of the new methods that have come to the forefront in the past few months.

The schedule is as follows:



	
  * 18:30 - 19:00: Arrive and mingle

	
  * 19:00 - 20:00: To bind or not to bind panel

	
  * 20:00 - 21:00: Open discussion

	
  * 21:00 - ?: To the pub!
