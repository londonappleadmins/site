As well as our guest speakers, we'll be having a panel discussion, entitled "Ask us anything". Whether you're new to the Apple Admin scene or a seasoned veteran, we encourage you to ask our panel anything you like. We want to provoke interesting discussion and debate in a non-judgemental environment. When you register, you can submit a question for the panel ahead of time by filling in that part of the form.

If you'd like to be on the panel, tick the box when you register and we'll let you know if you've been considered (do you feel lucky?).

As always, the event is free to attend but space is limited. We've got 100 tickets available, grab one in advance here:
