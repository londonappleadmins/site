As always, the event was free to attend.

It wouldn't be Just Eat if there wasn't food involved, and certainly was no disappointment there! Sachin kindly arranged a banquet fit for the hungriest of admins - an assortment of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, with loads of pizza (vegetarian and meat)! Nom!
