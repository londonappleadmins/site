title: We shall return, very soon...

London Apple Admins didn't die, we just took a hiatus (at least in person) during what has been a horrific couple of years. Hot on the heels of [MacADUK](https://www.macad.uk/), we will rise again!

We'll be back with a bang in early May for our first in-person meetup since 2020 but we can't do it without those folks who step forward to give their amazing talks. They say fortune favours the brave, so if you're feeling bold and fancy presenting at our first of hopefully many traditional-style events, we hope you'll [click here and reach out](/get-involved/)! 

(or [just hunt down one of the herders](/about/) in #london on the [MacAdmins Slack](https://macadmins.org))
