I"~<p>For our first meet of 2016, the lovely people at <a href="https://thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a> are hosting us again. This meet will be slightly different - rather than presentations, we are having a steel cage deathmatch style panel entitled “To bind or not to bind” featuring David Acland (Amsys), Yannis Lagogiannis (LSE) and Francois Levaux-Tiffreau (Amaris).</p>
