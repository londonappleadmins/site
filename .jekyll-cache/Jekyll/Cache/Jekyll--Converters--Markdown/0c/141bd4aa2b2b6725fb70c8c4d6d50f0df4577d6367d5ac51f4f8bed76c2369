<p>That’s great! London Apple Admins is a welcoming, friendly community; an ideal place to dip your toe into public speaking if you’re new or seasoned. You’ll be surrounded by like minded people who share your passion and want you to succeed.</p>

<p>Whether you’re someone who works (or aspires to work) in the admin space or a vendor, we’d love to hear from you. The usual format for talks is 10-15 minutes but if you have an idea for something longer, give us a shout. Talks can be about almost anything, some examples being:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A technical talk or story about something you’ve done</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An open discussion about something you’re interested in or want to learn more about</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A technical, factual demo of a technology/product or feature of a technology/product</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We welcome talks from vendors, but sales pitches will be met with a loud burst of air horn (we’re not joking!). We get enough sales pitches at work, we do not want them on our own time please.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We’d be incredibly grateful. Sponsorship can include things like providing a venue, food and/or drink for an event. In return, we’ll publicly thank you at the start and end of the event, with your logo on our slides and a mention to folks recommending that they check you/your product out if they’re interested. Feel free to distribute swag - we love it!</p>
