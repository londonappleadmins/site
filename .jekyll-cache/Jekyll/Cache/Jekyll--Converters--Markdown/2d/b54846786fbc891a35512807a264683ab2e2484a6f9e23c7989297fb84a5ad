Whether youâ€™re new to the Apple Admin scene or a seasoned veteran, we encouraged you to ask our panel anything you like. We wanted to provoke interesting discussion and debate in a non-judgemental environment. When you registered, you could submit a question for the panel ahead of time by filling in that part of the form.</p>
