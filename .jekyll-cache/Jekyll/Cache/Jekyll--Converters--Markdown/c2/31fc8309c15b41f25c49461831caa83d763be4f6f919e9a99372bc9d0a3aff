I"×<p>As we get used to the â€œnew normalâ€, itâ€™s more important than ever to focus on deploying the most up to date software. AutoPkg has been a mainstay of the Mac Admin toolbox since 2014 and weâ€™re delighted to host the awesome Anthony Reimer as he joins us all the way from Canada to lead a workshop that will take you to the next level! Thank you to the lovely folks at <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a> for sponsoring the Zoom session!</p>
