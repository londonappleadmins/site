I"t<p>We are still looking for somewhere to host our meet in September - we are hoping to have it in the first two weeks of September, but are flexible on those dates. Our needs are very modest - a screen / projector, internet connectivity and space for around 40 people are all we need.</p>

<p>If you know of anywhere that might be able to help us, please let us know!</p>
