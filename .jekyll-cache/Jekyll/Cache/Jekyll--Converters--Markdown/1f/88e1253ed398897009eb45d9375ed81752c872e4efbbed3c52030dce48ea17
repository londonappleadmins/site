I"q<p>London Apple Admins had a bit of a sabbatical. But fear not, we came back! Our October meet of 2019 was Jamf-packed when we joined erm, <a href="https://www.jamf.com/">Jamf</a> at their offices in Clerkenwell! It was an eventful time of year with new OS releases from Apple, you came to our arena, kicked back with a Sangria* and did the Macarena as we welcomed Catalina!</p>

<p>Thank you to our speakers and special thanks to Megan Bull and Matt Taylor of Jamf who put in so much hard work to host and sponsored us!</p>
