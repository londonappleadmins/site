Whether youâ€™re new to the Apple Admin scene or a seasoned veteran, we encourage you to ask our panel anything you like. We want to provoke interesting discussion and debate in a non-judgemental environment. When you register, you can submit a question for the panel ahead of time by filling in that part of the form.</p>

<p>If youâ€™d like to be on the panel, tick the box when you register and weâ€™ll let you know if youâ€™ve been considered (do you feel lucky?).</p>

<p>As always, the event is free to attend but space is limited. Weâ€™ve got 100 tickets available, grab one in advance here:</p>
