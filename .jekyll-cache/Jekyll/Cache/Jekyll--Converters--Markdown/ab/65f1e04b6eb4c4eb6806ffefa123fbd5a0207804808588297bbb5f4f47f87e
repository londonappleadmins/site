I"Ï<p>If you in some manner manage or administer devices with an Apple logo &amp; work in London, or happen to be in town when a meet is happeningâ€¦ This is the group for you!</p>

<p>We generally run between 4 and 6 meetups a year in various locations across London.</p>

<p>Each meet up consists of a series 5 to 20 minute presentations, followed by Q &amp; A and discussions. These presentations can be a short â€œHelloâ€, â€œLook at this cool thing I didâ€ or â€œI really need help understanding <something>..." The idea is for these to create discussion points.</something></p>

<p>After the presentations; we eat, drinkÂ &amp; discuss.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s it.</p>

<p>If you want to know more, please reach out to one of the London Apple Admins Herders:</p>
