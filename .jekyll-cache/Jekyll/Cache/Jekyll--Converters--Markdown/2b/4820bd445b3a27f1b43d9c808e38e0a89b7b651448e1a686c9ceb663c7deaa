<p>As some of you may have heard, One of our fellow London Apple Admin herders was diagnosed with testicular cancer in January last year.</p>

<p>In November, <a href="https://grahamgilbert.com/">Graham Gilbertâ€™s</a> trademark beard will be going away, to be replaced by a glorious â€˜tache for <a href="https://uk.movember.com/">Movember</a>. He has setup a FaceBook fundraiser page and asks that instead of buying him a beer, please consider a donating.</p>

<p><a href="https://graham.at/fbmovember">If this matters to you, click here and please donate any amount you can spare.</a></p>

<p>If you use any of his software, or like his website or any of his talks, you owe him ;)</p>
